              <h2>Acceptance Is The First Step</h2>
                Acceptance is the first step to getting rid of toxic worry. Accept what has already happened. Accept that the past cannot be changed.
                Accept that it sucks. And finally accept that it can get much worse before it can get better. <br><br>
                This is life. Most of it is out of our control. Yes you have control over getting up right now, and mosying to the kitchen to grab
                a snack. And yes you have control over what time you'll go to bed tonight. But maybe not...Maybe your sister calls you out of the 
                blue, and asks for you to drive over to her place at 10:30pm. You have a really important work meeting in the morning and you wanted 
                to get a good nights rest, but it's an emergency. Your sister needs you. You do have the choice to tell her no. But maybe a tree 
                falls through your roof and decimates your bedroom. There better example...Now you're screwed. Your sleep is going to be compromised. 
                How do you react? <br><br>
                <img class="blogimg2" src="./images/worry2.jpeg" alt="">   
                Lets backpedal and let me start with an example. It was about four years ago my wife and I took a trip overseas to Europe. We spent our 
                first week in Lisbon and our second in Barcelona. The trip was nothing short of perfect. Beaches, wine, tapas, sunshine, history: the works.
                Upon leaving to head home we made sure to give ourselves a few extra hours in the airport to get ourselves situated. We get through 
                initial security and have to walk through the duty-free store to get to the terminals. Of course we grab a basket 
                and start loading it up. Why not? We still have two hours at this point before our flight 
                takes off. Time slips by, we keep browsing, and finally I check the time to see we have about fifteen minutes until boarding starts. Time 
                to go. We hurry over to the checkout and settle up with the clerk. As we are rounding the corner to the terminals I'm telling my wife "We
                still have time but we are starting to cut it close here let's pick up the pace a little." <br><br>
                We turn the corner and boom. There is a line of about 
                four hundred people smack dab in front of us. Sh*t. Of course we have to go through customs before we can get to our terminal. How could we be
                so stupid thinking otherwise. Both of us have traveled abroad countless times, so this isn't new news. There are three 
                windows open. Boarding now starts in about ten minutes. Our flight takes off in fifty. After customs we still have to get to the other side of 
                the airport to our terminal. This is about to be a very very expensive mistake. Not to mention the fact that we will most likely be sleeping 
                in the terminal overnight. <br><br> 
                I let out a "Welp". My wife slowly turns her head around and I'll honestly never forget that look. She was looking at me like I was 
                in the middle of the airport, stark-naked, and riding a unicorn. "Welp?" she asks? "What welp?? How can you possibly be this way??" 
                Fact of the matter is though, that we're helpless. What can we honestly do? It's like being stuck on the highway in bumper to bumper traffic.
                Noone is just magically teleporting there car out of there. You have to wait til the next exit. Why get anxious and worry about it. This 
                is life. And life royally sucks sometimes, it's a part of it. I always tell myself without these terrible times, we'd never be able to 
                identify the good times. You need the bad in order to be able to recognize the good. <br><br>
                <img class="blogimg2" src="./images/worry3.jpeg" alt="">
                I'm expecting that we'll miss the flight. That's it. If we make it I'll be overjoyed, but right now in this moment, 
                I'm not going to worry about it. I start to hum a tune. At this point, my wife is ready to toss me off a bridge.  
                I turn to her and say "Listen, it's out of our control right? We f*cked 
                up and all we can do is go with the flow. Even if we miss the flight we'll figure it out. Let's just see. No use in worrying it's completely
                out of our control." She takes a deep breath and seems to calm down a little. Fast forward we make it through 
                customs, run to our terminal only to get pulled off to the side for a random-terrorist check. I'm laughing out loud thinking of 
                her reaction to <i>that.</i>, but that's for another time. <br><br>
                We wound up making the flight and everything was fine. We could have spent the next thirty minutes in that line though stressing, sweating, 
                and cursing. What would the use have been? Nothing would have changed. The outcome is the outcome. <br><br>
                Now, all of this is easier said than done of course, there needs to be a plan to handle these types
                of situations. <br><br>
                <h3>Being conscious of the triggering-event is the first step when trying to invoke a change.</h3> <br><br>
                Catching ourselves in real time and being able to identify the pattern is the beginning. Next step then is obviously 
                coming up with a coping mechanism. For me personally taking a deep breath is always the best. And then reminding myself
                how I have little control over the situation. And then reminding myself that I'm not a completely inept person and I will be able to 
                source a solution from somewhere. <br><br>
                I'm going to leave you with an ancient Zen teaching, something to meditate on: <br><br>
                <p id="rainerquote">
                    “A farmer and his son had a beloved black stallion who helped the family earn a living. One day, the horse ran away and their neighbors 
                    exclaimed, 'Your horse ran away, what terrible luck!' The farmer replied, 'Let's see.' <br><br>
                    A few days later, the horse returned home, leading a handful of wild mares back to the farm as well. The neighbors shouted out, 'Your horse has 
                    returned, and brought several horses home with him. What great luck!' The farmer replied, 'Let's see.' <br><br>
                    Later that week, the farmer’s son was trying to break one of the mares and she threw him to the ground, breaking his leg. The villagers cried, 
                    'Your son broke his leg, what terrible luck!' The farmer replied, 'Let's see.' <br><br>
                    A few weeks later, soldiers from the national army marched through town, recruiting all the able-bodied boys for the army. They did not 
                    take the farmer’s son, still recovering from his injury. Friends shouted, 'Your boy is spared, what 
                    tremendous luck!' To which the farmer replied, 'Let's see.' <br><br>
                    The End.
                </p> <br><br>
                No matter what life throws our way whether its good times or bad times we still never know what is directly around the corner from us. It's best
                to try and squash those worries and fears because ultimately life happens, it will be both bad at times, and good at times. All we can do is strap in
                and go for the ride.
