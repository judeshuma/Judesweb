02.07.24 - I scrapped my original buildout because it just seemed too easy. I was using Wordpress. I decided to instead, buy a server (a VM on IONOS) and build it out on my local using npm. Simultaneously I want to learn how to use git&github in a more formal manner for the dev process. I'm currently using SCP to push the updated files to my server. Having a blast!

02.14.24 - Finally committing the build out I've been doing on my local server - second version -

02.15.24 Cleaned up my code and now attempting to create a new repository that I can push and pull from moving forward.
