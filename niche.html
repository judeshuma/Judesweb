            <p>
                For a long time marketing was a concept that was just barely out of reach. I understood what it was but I couldn't quite
                grasp it's functionality and importance. It was like yeah, okay, marketing, got it - but how do I actually turn it into 
                results I can see? It's not something that just comes naturally, I had to figure it out on my own.<br><br>
                Okay before we fully get into it, let's tap into the definition of "niche". Niche is defined as products, services,
                or interests that appeal to a small, specialized section of the population. So when we are talking about niche we are talking about
                sub-groups of groups of people. Or maybe even sub-sub-groups. See the photo below of some examples and how we can break down markets into niches. <br><br>
                <img class="blogimg" src="./images/nicheMarket Large.jpeg" alt="">
                Now let's take an example: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3CkNneXMjQdZ3cMGYLfWke?si=06YmyOxrS0K-JsPjiw2YIg">my amazing music</a>. We can start with a broad market 
                - "Rock" - and then go smaller - 
                "Indie Rock" - and then even smaller "Psychedelic Indie Rock". This is where I lie. Okay now how can I reach that specific
                target demographic. Let's move on to Spotify. <br><br>
                I really do loathe Spotify, but not for the platform itself, the design and convenience of it are both priceless. I loathe them 
                because they are blood-sucking greedy pigs literally preying on the already poor artist community. Okay nothing new here, I can 
                stop with my rant. So what was so useful about Spotify for marketing? Well two things: <br>
                <ul>
                  <li>1. Artist-Based Radio Stations Curated by Algorithmic Data</li>
                  <li>2. The Spotify for Artist Application</li>
                </ul>
                Let's start with the radio station. Now mind you, you have to have a certain amount of streams and data for Spotify to be able to create this 
                radio station for you. But once it's created it's priceless. If you haven't gotten that far yet then you can also use the "Fans Also Like" section. 
                Within these features, Spotify is saying if Person A likes Band1, Band2, and Band3, and Person B likes Band1 and Band2...Then let's suggest Band3 to
                Person 2 based off of Person 1's tastes. So in short, they are suggesting music based off of actual user's tastes. So when I go into my 
                <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E4x1u1h64HNR0?si=8e858716678243bf">Jude Shuma Radio</a> (shameless plug I know), I can see what 
                other artists my fanbase is listening to. Now there are so many ways to use this information. You can create advertisements targeting fans of those bands,
                you can go into Instagram directly targeting the followers of these bands, you can find when these bands are touring and try to book shows 
                with them. It's endless. <br><br>

                Spotify For Artists on the other hand will actually spell it all out for you. You can see what playlists are giving you the most traction, what countries/cities
                have the most listeners, and the demographics behind those listeners (gender & age). All of this information put together gives you a much clearer
                picture of who your listener-base is. 

                With a clearer understanding of who your fanbase is and where they are geographically located you have an opportunity for growth.
