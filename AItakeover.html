                This isn’t our first rodeo, nor will it be our last. Periods of massive technological advancement have come before us and will 
                seemingly come again. The Industrial Revolution was the first major change in how we as humans produced goods. The fear that machines 
                would take over entirely was widespread. What did this mean for certain industries? Would the need for human workers become obsolete? 
                Things would definitely be different, but not in the bad way perceived. The technological changes would actually do the opposite of 
                what was feared most. <br><br>

                The Industrial Revolution actually created an increase in employment opportunities. And not only that, the wages one could make at a 
                factory were higher than those of the farmers. Factories started to pop up across the country which then created management roles on 
                top of the additional employees. It became the snowball effect. <br><br>
                
                <img class="blogimg" src="./images/AItakeover.jpeg" alt="">

                People migrated towards the cities for the work, the need for housing 
                naturally increased which in turn helped with city planning and the overall infrastructure. Again, not the same industry, but yet again 
                more jobs were created for a new need (housing). This is all of course over a longer stretch 
                of time. The near term had some disadvantages like pollution, child labor, and food shortages. <br><br>
                
                AI will take care of the autonomous jobs and provide room for growth in more creative and critical thinking jobs. It won’t take away 
                the need for design, quality control, and management. Tesla unveiled today they will be showcasing their 
                <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/tesla-to-unveil-robotaxi-on-aug-8-elon-musk-says-on-x-92faacfa">RoboTaxi</a> for the first time 
                come August. Just because the cars will drive themselves doesn’t mean there won’t be a need for servicing, customer support, and management. <br><br>
                <img class="blogimg" src="./images/robotaxi.jpeg" alt="">
                <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/large-language-model/"> LLMs</a> (Large Language Models) are already in need of people to help train them. We have to remember AI can’t just learn on it’s own, 
                it needs to be taught, it needs data input. It depends on it. You can’t expect a chatbot to just know how to reply and what to tell you, 
                it needs to learn this over time. Researchers, engineers, cyber security specialists are all potential professions to come from this 
                new wave of technology. <br><br>
                
                A good Show on HULU called <a href="https://www.hulu.com/series/a-murder-at-the-end-of-the-world-aa1adbb2-bfd6-4d88-b709-5455bf953f9e">Murder at the End of the World</a> 
                showcases how the logic behind AI still has a ways to go. From learning how 
                to code I have come to understand that literally every little step in a process needs to be spelled out for the computer. The computer 
                does not have common sense, it can’t make assumptions. Everything must be spelled out otherwise things can go awry. I won't spoil the series 
                but I will say the show does a good job of representing that concept.<br><br>
                
                There are many benefits to AI. Among the list are reduction of human error, handling repetitive tasks, processing big data, digital assistance,
                improvement of taskflows, and quicker decision making. AI is good for a lot of things but ultimately human creativity is irreplaceable. 
                Hopefully artificial intelligence will make way for a more enjoyable life. It has the power to rid our lives of the tedious boring tasks. Sure 
                it will be a big change in how we function as a society, but in 
                the near term there really isn't much to worry about. <br><br>

                So go back to sleep, AI hasn't taken over the world yet.
