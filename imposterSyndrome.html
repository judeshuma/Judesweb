                <h2>What's Imposter Syndrome?</h2>

                Imposter syndrome is a psychological condition in which one feels they are not worthy of their success, despite 
                their knowledge or achievements. It’s common practice for individuals experiencing it to chalk their 
                accomplishments up to luck or external circumstances. It’s not a diagnosable disorder. Studies have shown 
                there is a correlation between depression and anxiety. If you experience either of these you are more susceptible to
                falling victim to this behavior. <br><br>

                Imposter Syndrome is more likely to occur in marginalized groups but that’s not to say it can’t happen to anyone
                 at anytime. According to some loose estimates, 70% of people are likely to experiencing it at least once 
                 in their life. And that one time could be enough to shatter the potential of an opportunity. If left unnoticed
                  it can have a substantial impact on one’s career and performance. Doctors, programmers, artists; It doesn't matter 
                  what field you are pursuing, you are still vulnerable to it. <br><br>
                

                <h2>How To Identify It</h2>
                
                Since there is no test or immediate way of diagnosing the disorder, we have to learn to identify it by analyzing ourselves.
                 There are specific characteristics that might
                 give light to someone experiencing it. The term was first coined in 1978 by psychologists Suzanna Imes and Pauline
                  Rose Clance. The irony of it is most people who experience it are well-accomplished, highly intelligent
                   individuals. They receive some type of recognition for their efforts and start to compare themselves to everyone else.
                    It’s also very common amongst artists who have received critical acclaim for a piece of work. Since art is completely
                    subjective it's even worse for them. Why me? All of the hours of work and time put in suddenly disappear from the mind. <br><br>

                    <h2>Let's Give An Example</h2>
                    
                    Imagine a newfound actor or actress standing up to receive an Oscar. It's been two years in Hollywood and their track record is still 
                    pretty much nonexistent. They we're in the running
                    with people they have spent their entire life admiring or worshipping. Hollywood veterans so to speak. And to that person's surprise they win the award. Immediately they
                    might start questioning if they deserve this or it's a mistake. Maybe they saw the other movies and thought they underperformed
                    comparitively. How could I possibly win this when such amazing, talented people also we're nominated...This is imposter syndrome. 

                     <br><br>
                

                <h2>List of Characteristics To Look Out For</h2>        
                 
                <div style="background-color: rgb(240, 240, 240); padding: 10px;"><br>
                <b>- Attributing one’s past successes to luck or other external factors</b><br><br>
                <b>- Being sensitive to constructive criticism</b><br><br>
                <b>- Feelings of being found out as a fraud</b><br><br>
                <b>- Fears that you won’t live up to <a class="links" href="expectations.html">expectations</a></b><br><br>

                </div><br>
   
                <h2 id="dunning">Own Your Story & Own Your Success</h2>
                
                If you have put in the work and shown signs of success that’s amazing news. Rather than dismiss this though, own it. If you start
                 to feel bouts of imposter syndrome coming on, stop yourself in real time and reassure yourself that you are deserving. 

                 <br><br>

                <img class="blogimg2" src="./images/ImposterSyndrome-OpenGraph.jpeg" alt="">

                <h2>Coping Mechanisms</h2>

                There is always a way out of the dirt. The best way to impose changes is to catch yourself in the act and employ the coping strategy of your choice. For 
                instance, if you find yourself in the moment starting to have thoughts doubting yourself, you can actively tell yourself "I do deserve this because I 
                have worked hard to get here." By disrupting the chain of thought, you can begin a new one in which you don't fall victim to these negative thoughts.
                And yes I understand that this may sound a little straight forward and almost stupid. But you'd be amazed at how quickly the moment comes and goes. Practice 
                giving yourself words of affirmation during these times. Sometimes the most simple and basic strategy is the best. <br><br>

                There will always be someone who is more talented or experienced than you, and that's OKAY. That doesn’t mean you yourself don’t deserve credit for 
                your own efforts. Let go of trying to be a perfectionist and start accepting where you are and what you have done. Learn to cultivate a little self-compassion.   <br><br>
                
                <img class="blogimg3" src="images/imposterComic.jpeg" alt="">

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                Maybe you are at a different point in your own career than where you want to be. Instead of feeling ashamed, turn it into pride and acceptance. We are all only human. Living
                in the age of social media where we consume mostly 'highlights' of other people's lives can be extremely toxic. It often leads to feelings of being inadequate or
                self-loathing. You belong here just as much as anyone else does and your accomplishments should be celebrated rather than dismissed. Return to the growth-mindset 
                and learn to see every little success as a stepping stone. Celebrate them now and strive to continue to do better. Most importantly don't fall victim to imposter syndrome.  <br><br><br>
