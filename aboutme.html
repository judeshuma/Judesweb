          Hello, my name is Jude Shuma. I am an inherently curious individual from Chicago, IL. I am proud to say I have
          a bachelors degree in English Literature. My life has been far from convention which is 
          probably why I am here writing this now. I have pursued art for the majority of my adult 
          life. At one point I was working four different jobs on a weekly basis to fund the build out of my recording studio.
          I still own and operate that studio to this day. I have written music for commercials and movies. 
          Landed my songs on multiple major American Television Networks. I even learned to daytrade the stock market 
          to allow more time and freedom to make art. I found later that the stress outweighed the reward...not for me. But hey it was a great 
          learning experience. 
          I have found love by walking up to a complete stranger 9 years ago. I even taught
          myself her language (Georgian) და ეხლა შემიძლია დავწერო და წავიკითხო ქართულად. I was desperate to
          be done with school my whole life only to find I will spend my entire life studying. Poke around, send me an email, 
          I love connecting with new people. 
          <!-- Last year I decided to start teaching music again. I made an online profile and forgot about it. About three weeks later,
          I received an email from a now friend, inquiring about guitar lessons. I sent him a reply email asking some questions. As it turned out,
          he was extremely tech-savy. I agreed to give him lessons but under one condition: He would be my mentor in the tech-space. Since then I 
          have developed a deep passion for all things tech. Web Development, design, creating applications; It has consumed me. So poke around, 
          send me a message, I love connecting with new individuals. Thanks for being here. -->

      <p>I decided after much debate to just start over. I kicked
        my Wordpress and purchased a Linux server. 
        I wanted to build a website from nothing. My journey in music production has been 
        nothing short of "Figure it out as I go". And programming
        has a lot of parallels in that regard. This site has been built on
        HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript, Ubuntu, Apache, 
        MySQL, PHP, DNS, Node JS, Bootstrap, SSH, SCP and SSL. 
        Somewhere along the way I came up with the idea for <a style="text-decoration: none; color: white;" href="https://chordo.app">Chordo</a>. <br><br>
        Which lead me to learning Python3, then Flask, WSGI...
        It's like I knew what I was getting into...but was also forcing a bit of naivety.
        I started to write about all of this because I love writing, so why not? Maybe I'll
        tap into some of those old psychology books while I'm at it. Right though, back to the code stuff. 
        Programming is a lot like music. You start creating something and then you break it down.
        There's harmony in there somewhere just like there's harmony in one's code. Everything
        needs to fit just right. Microscopic details can't go unnoticed. 
        Oh and also like music, it's a whole lot of back and forthing. 
        Like a whole whole lot -- bunch of back and forthing.
