            <h2 style="padding: 10px;">What Is Minimalism?</h2>
            <p style="text-indent: 0%;">Minimalism by definition is a style or technique that is characterized by extreme spareness and simplicity. Minimalists believe that 
                <i>less is more</i>. This doesn't necessarily mean you need to renounce all of your worldly possessions and get rid of your belongings. Minimalism encourages
                 you to be less attached to objects and promotes putting more importance on the people and events in your life 
                 instead. Adjusting to a minimalistic lifestyle starts with organizing and decluttering your home. Take a look around, are there items on the floor without a 
                 place to go? Do you have piles of papers on your desk or counters? Are your shelves stacked with multiple layers? <br>

                <b><p style="background-color: rgb(240, 240, 240); padding: 10px;">By practicing minimalism and decluttering our living spaces we can reduce levels of stress and induce feelings of relaxation.</p></b>

                There is power in decluttering your home and living more minimalistically. By letting go of “stuff” we are releasing some stress and anxiety. Physical clutter
                 can lead to mental clutter. Research has shown there is a direct correlation between disorganization and messiness, and our ability to focus and feel at ease. <br><br>

                 <h2>What Is a Hoarder?</h2>  

                 Take a look at the picture above? How does it make you feel? Do you think you could sit in that room and feel relaxed? Maybe read a <a href="https://amzn.to/3UQ0MlN">book</a>? The above photo is an extreme 
                 example of a hoarder. <br><br>
                 
                 A hoarder is a person who compulsively accumulates and stores excessive amounts of objects or possessions, often to the point where it interferes with 
                 their daily life, living space, and overall well-being. <br><br>
            
              <b><p style="background-color: rgb(240, 240, 240); padding: 10px;">If you can't find it because it's buried, how can you expect to use it?</p></b>
              
              <h2>The Low-Key Hoarder</h2> 

              Listen I get it. You have some emotional connection to that little figurine and it has to stay. And that sweater is old now, but there's a chance it might 
              come back in style again soon. So you have no choice but to keep it. The thing is, you do have a choice. <br><br>
              
              We all have trouble letting go of things. In our mind the "what if" statement immediately steps in. The second I get rid of 
              it will be the second I come across the need for it. Or if I get rid of it, I may forget that memory attached to it.
              This still proposes the idea that there are lesser degress of hoarding.

              The low-key hoarder might not actually have a house filled with stuff to the brim. It will take more time to fill up your closet and storage areas. Eventually though,
              things will start to find a place on the floor because there is nowhere left to put them. <br><br>

              <h2>Ways Of Implementing Minimalism</h2> 
              
              <div style="background-color: rgb(240, 240, 240); padding: 10px;"><br>
                <b>1. Declutter Regularly:</b> Try to set a schedule where once a month you go through your entire place and ask yourself am I going to use this or need this? Take it to goodwill, donate the clothes to the less fortunate or even try and sell them if you are feeling extra ambitious. <br><br>
                <b>2. Practice Mindfulness When Consuming:</b>  When purchasing something ask yourself: Do I need this or just want this? Do I have space for this??<br><br>
                <b>3. One In One Out Rule :</b> For every time you bring something new into your home you have to remove something.<br><br>
                <b>4. Lower The Amount Of Storage Available:</b> Try not to add to your storage space, the more space you have the more you will accumulate because it has a place to go. Things will end up out of sight and you won’t have to address the underlying clutter.<br><br>
                <b>5. Detach Yourself:</b>Remember that items don’t make up who you are, even if there is an emotional attachment they don’t define you as a person. They aren’t inherently tied to who you are.<br><br>
                <b>6. Seek Support:</b>Invite or family or friends to help you let go, sometimes it takes having someone else around to really allow yourself to let go, you feel more supported because someone’s physical presence gives grace.

                <h2>Accumulation Over Time Adds Up</h2>

                Little bits tend to add up. Over the course of a few years you’d be surprised at how much extra stuff you’ve accumulated. If you are not making a conscious
                effort, chances are you'll fall victim to it. We all tend to be hoarders to some degree or another. <br><br>

                You can stay more organized when you have less things. You are much more likely to know where everything is because there are fewer places where it could be.
                 Before you purchase something new think to yourself do I really need this or do I just want this? If I do in fact get this and bring it home where will it go?
                  Do I have the space for it or is it going to end up in a pile somewhere and disappear? <br><br>
                  
                  Set some time aside to start to declutter your home. If it feels overwhelming,
                  then <a href="problem.html">break it down into chunks.</a> Start with the closet in the spare bedroom, or the front hall closet. Or maybe your living room. Start with 
                  only items on the floor or counters that don't have a true home. A donation pile can then begin and you can be well on your way.
