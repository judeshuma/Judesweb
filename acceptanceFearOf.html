            <h2 style="padding: 10px;">The Fear Of Missing Out</h2>
            <p style="text-indent: 0%;" style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: sans-serif;">

                It wasn’t like it happened yesterday, this was years ago. It was a sunny Chicago afternoon in July. The perfect
                 weather for a bike ride to the lake followed by a cool-off swim. It was like the day was just asking for it. And yet 
                 somehow I found myself doing quite the opposite. I was sitting in a friend’s dark, stale apartment. <br><br>

                We were on the couch watching a rerun of some TV show.
                My eyes kept drifting towards the windows. Slivers of sunlight were peaking through the edge of the curtains. Dust particles suspended in the air. Everyone was
                too hungover to care. And if I wanted to be a part of the hang, then this was what we were doing today. <br><br>
                
                Why did I feel this need 
                to be a part of the hang and do whatever my friends wanted to do all the time? Was it some subconscious fear of missing out? Deep down I was always afraid 
                of some new inside joke forming, and if I wasn't there, I'd be left out in the future. Suddenly I found myself
                asking “If I don’t want to be here, then why am I actually here?”<br><br> 

                People talk of these lightbulb moments in life where suddenly everything clicks into place. I'm testifying here right now that 
                they do in fact exist. The lightbulb went on. <br><br>

                <b><p style="background-color: rgb(240, 240, 240); padding: 10px;">This crippling anxiety that if I don’t fit in, I’ll end up sad and alone. But the irony of it is, 
                the more I tried to force myself into being something I wasn't, the more depressed and alone I felt.</p></b><br>

                You see, for most of my life, I battled that same inherent fear of not being included. That crippling anxiety that if I don’t fit in, I’ll
                end up sad and alone. But the irony of it is, the more I tried to force myself into being something I wasn't, the more depressed
                and alone I actually felt. This all goes back to the idea of<a class="newLinks" href="imposterSyndrome.html"> Imposter Syndrome</a>. Although back then we called it being a "poser".<br>

                <h2>The Inherent Desire To Fit In</h2>

                The fact is most people, if not all, want to feel that same acceptance. Especially by those in their inner friend circles. Younger generations
                will do whatever it takes to feel like they <i>belong</i>. This can explain why so many young people join gangs, clubs or churches. They
                crave that feeling of being “in”. And this doesn't just apply to the youth, adults face these same challenges day in and day out. <br><br>

                <img class="blogimg4" src="images/punkFriends2.jpeg" alt=""> <br>


                If we go back to evolutionary times, going against one's group could be rather pricey. It took the group as a whole to be successful
                and survive. Every person had their place in making things work. That is clearly not the case anymore. Yes we depend on each other but no 
                we are not going to die of starvation if one person diverges from the group. <br><br>

                <h2>What I've Learned From <i>Not</i> Trying To Fit In</h2>
                
                <div style="background-color: rgb(240, 240, 240); font-weight: bolder; padding: 10px;"><p>
                    <li>1. You Can Always Make New Friends</li><br>
                    <li>2. You Only Get One Life So <a class="newLinks" href="nihilism.html">You Might As Well</a></li><br>
                    <li>3. By Choosing Myself and Not Trying To Fit In I Found Where I Belong</li><br>
                    <li>4. Those "Cool" People Amount To Nothing In The End</li><br>
                    <li>5. You Have To Suck It Up and Be Vulnerable</li>
                </p></div><br><br>

                <style>
                    h3 {
                        font-family: Montserrat;
                        text-align: left;
                        padding: 0px;
                        text-indent: 0%;
                    }
                </style>


                <h3>You Can Always Make New Friends</h3>

                Pick something you actually enjoy doing. Find something that really interests you. It could be anything. Photography, books, painting,
                gardening, learning an instrument, learning a language, homebrewing beer, a sport, outdoor activities like fishing or hiking; You get the idea. Friendships
                are formed on common grounds. You make friends at work because you share the same job or industry. You make friends in sports because you 
                all love playing that game. So choose something that genuinely interests you and find a club, meetup, or event. Yes you are going to have to 
                put yourself out there, but the chances of making a new friend are high. And if you do come away with a new friend, the chances that that friendship 
                will be more meaningful than the contrived ones you loathe are pretty great. <br><br>

                <h3>You Only Get One Life So You Might As Well</h3>

                I spent so much time worrying and trying to fit in that I lost out on a good portion of it. Just go for it. You might as well because at the end of 
                the day you have nothing to lose. It's back to that <a class="newLinks" href="nihilism.html">Sunny Nihilism</a> mindset. <br><br>

                <h3>By Choosing Myself and Not Trying To Fit In I Found Where I Belong</h3>

                I stopped worrying about trying to be someone I was not and because of that I started to really shape into who I wanted to be. 
                Trying to get people to like you is exhausting. You spend more time worrying than anything. By naturally spending my time doing things 
                that interested me and putting myself out there I slowly found my natural place in this universe. <br><br>

                <h3>Those "Cool" People Amount To Nothing In The End</h3>

                If we look back at all the people we wanted to impress back in the day and where they are in life and where you are it's clear that 
                it really doesn't matter. They wound up pursuing their own life and you wound up pursuing yours. <br><br>
                
                <h3>You Have To Suck It Up and Be Vulnerable</h3>

                Probably the hardest part in all of this. Everyone hates to feel vulnerable. Which is why we tend to stay in our friend circles 
                regardless of how happy we are. Comfort kills they say. It's easier to just stay rather than put yourself out there and feel exposed. Anxiety is real in all of 
                this. But if you can force yourself out of your hole you will be surprised. Even if you are awkward and have a hard time socializing, I still 
                believe that everyone is capable of making new friends. <br><br>

                <b><p style="background-color: rgb(240, 240, 240); padding: 10px;">I found myself often times frustrated that I wasn't doing what I actually wanted to be doing. It felt like I was just wasting my time 
                    because I was too afraid of not fitting in.</p></b><br>
                             
                <img class="blogimg4" src="images/footballFriends Large.jpeg" alt=""> <br><br>
                    
                <h2>Conclusion To All Of This: Choose Yourself</h2>

                At some point in time I decided I wanted to pursue music. That was my dream, and spending time at a baseball game or doing things that 
                didn't interest me was not going to get me there. I needed to find my own place in this world rather than try and fit into the circles that 
                life dealt me through school and growing up. I used social media to find other recording engineers, got a practice space where a recording studio 
                was. I began to make friends with other musicians who also had a space there. From there it all snowballed. The funny thing is, I still don't 
                think I fit in at this point. I still feel like I'm an outsider to the so-called "cool club" here in Chicago's music scene. But you know what screw it. Because I'm happy. I finally
                 feel like I am myself, and that is all that matters. You deserve to be happy too. My advice: Choose yourself and life will start choosing you.
