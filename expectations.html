            <p><b>03.02.24</b></p>
            <p>You have to keep them low. And this is why it sucks. The second you start letting them creep up it's over.
                It's like letting disappointment marry your best friend. All of the sudden it's around all the time.
                <br>It's the forever dilemna. Do you set them unreasonably high? Invoke some 
                 type of inferiority complex? Or bottom of the barrell low? Bottom of the barrell low and you may 
                 find yourself never being disappointed. <br>
                </p>

                <p>
                We here at JudesWeb believe low expectations will breathe something into your dull, boring, life. Give yourself the chance
                to feel like you can succeed. I've set the bar high for myself. Personally I find it hard (this is why it sucks). <br>
                I look at low expectations like the whole grain oatmeal instead of the double bacon egg and cheese sausage biscuit. it that
                fresh for natural wholesome
                growth. By lowering one's expectations we are allowing ourselves to attain that nirvana state. Total Zen.
                I'm always impressed because I expect nothing.  We all have to deal with it. It sucks that it sucks that we all have to deal with it. Keep
                them low. Being realistic sucks too actually but that's a part of it. <br><br>
                Expectations often times lack empathy. They can be toxic to our mental health. We feel let down and sad because
                they weren't met. According to Merriam-Webster "expect" by definition is "to consider probable or certain". 
                In relationships whether it's coworkers or friends or even family members, we set up expectations of the love and attention
                we give, maybe we are more thoughtful and expect that same thoughtfulness to be recipricated. This all ends in feelings of 
                despondency. Things rarely just go our way. Expect problems. Expect failures. Expect expectations. 
                <br><br>
                You expect your coworker to pick up the slack and get their half of the job done. Instead they don't do a damn 
                thing and you are left holding the bag. Had you expected them to do absolutely nothing you would have 
                been pleasantly surprised to know they did a fraction of a fraction of the work they were assigned. Things
                start to feel unfair and this leads to resentment. Which can trickle down further into passive aggressiveness.
                Nobody needs this. Lets be real about it.

                As both a teacher and a student now I can relate to both sides. Everything takes time to transpire. The world we live
                in is constantly changing. I expect a website to load in under 1.5 seconds maximum.
