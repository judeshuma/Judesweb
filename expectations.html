            <p><h2>The Importance Of Keeping Expectations In Check</h2> It's not as easy as it sounds. It takes time, practice, and repetition to learn to keep your expectations in check.
                We as humans are habitual creatures by default. It doesn't take much to form a bad habit. It's important to practice mindfulness when placed in a position where expectations are in play. Maybe you
                got nominated for an award in your industry, or maybe you recently had a job interview and you're waiting to hear back. Whether you win the award or get the job, it 
                shouldn't have that much of an affect on your feelings. <br><br>
                
                If you know that regardless of winning the award or getting the job, that you will continue to strive to do better and continue to push on, then the outcome shouldn't matter. Despite
                how things turn out, you already know this is not the end all be all. Great if things do go in your favor, but being prepared is the key to maintaining a healthy mind. <br><br>
                
                <h5 style="background-color: rgb(240, 240, 240); padding: 10px; font-family: Archivo Black;">Setting very high expectations 
                 is like disappointment marrying your best friend. All of the sudden, disappointment's around all the time. And noone wants to be disappointed all the time.</h5><br>
                
                Not to say you shouldn't be optimistic, but protecting yourself is important. Keeping your expectations in check is important.
                 Constant high expectations can be toxic to our mental health. We feel let down and sad because they weren't met. If this starts to become
                 repetitive over time, it can have a significant impact on our overall well being. <br><br>


              </p>
             
              <p>
                According to Merriam-Webster "expect" by definition is "to consider probable or certain". In relationships whether it's coworkers or friends or 
                even family members, we set our expectations according to the love and attention
                we give. We think because we did this or would have done that, everyone else would do the same. But everyone is in fact different. And if no two people
                are identical, how can it be possible that they would do the exact same thing in the same situation? <br><br>
                
                <img src="./images/expectations.png" class="blogimg3">

                <h2>Real Life Scenarios</h2>
                Maybe you are more thoughtful and expect that same thoughtfulness to be reciprocated. Maybe by default you over-achieve at your job,
                and then expect everyone else to perform in the same fashion. Maybe you bought your sister an amazing birthday present and when the time
                came for her to get you one, she forgot. <br><br>
                
                How you managed your expecations through all of these scenarios will have defined how you feel at the end. 
                If not properly managed, all of these situations will have end with feelings of despondency. Nobody works as hard at you at your job and 
                your sister didn't plan an exotic cruise for your birthday like you did for her.    <br><br><br>

                <h5 style="background-color: rgb(240, 240, 240); padding: 10px; font-family: Archivo Black; display: flex; justify-content: center;">Things rarely just go our way.</h5><br>
                
                <h2>Measuring Happiness</h2>
                What are we expecting from these situations? Are we happy with the outcomes? Happiness can be measured by three factors: the presence of positive emotions, the absence of negative emotions, 
                and life satisfaction (Ryan & Deci, 2001). If are expectations are set too high, it will be nearly impossible to ever feel satisfied.  <br> <br>

                We should expect problems. Expect failures. Expect expectations. Manage Them.
                How can we put the proper practices into place? Communication is the answer. <br><br>
                
                <img class="blogimg3" src="./images/expectDrunk.jpeg" alt="">

                <h2>Communication To Manage Expectations</h2>
                Most times when expectations aren't met it's because they were 
                not properly communicated prior. Our understanding of what will actually happen and what "should" happen in our head are not aligned. 
                <br><br>


                Our partners can't read our minds. It's true. And honestly even if they could I'm not sure anyone would want that anyways. We all have our own 
                thoughts and opinions. And without knowing it, we don't always express them properly too. For instance, my wife doesn't know what I'm thinking every waking minute of the day. She doesn't 
                know what I want to do on my birthday. My birthday means a lot to me (actually it doesn't but let's be hypothetical). It just so happens my favorite bands in town, and I  want to go see them. 
                She already bought tickets for something else though. Now she's upset that her idea got squashed because she put a lot of thought into it. And you're upset that she's upset because 
                you didn't tell her what you thought the plans would be. Hard to believe she didn't know that right?
                 We need to <i>tell</i> others how we are feeling. We need to tell them what we're expecting or what we want. This is allowing us to now manage those expecations and not allow frustration.  <br><br>
                
                <h5 style="background-color: rgb(240, 240, 240); padding: 10px; font-family: Archivo Black;">Constantly I'm reminded by my wife, that she can't read my mind.</h5><br>

                <h2>High Expectations Stifle Growth</h2>
                High Expectations can stifle creativity and growth. If you get discouraged to quickly, because you thought the outcome was going to be better than it actually was,
                you may just give up too soon. This can limit your willingness to experiment and try something new. You might be more reluctant to take the risk and try something new 
                for fear of failure or not meeting expectations. This can stunt your potential for growth in the future.
  
                I found a quote a while back that has always stuck with me, <br><br>

                <p id="rainerquote"> "Once the realization is accepted that even between the closest human beings infinite distances continue, a wonderful living side by side can grow, 
                if they succeed in loving the distance between them which makes it possible for each to see the other whole against the sky." <b>- Rainer Maria Rilke</b></p> <br>
                
                <h5 style="background-color: rgb(240, 240, 240); padding: 10px; font-family: Archivo Black;">Low expectations will breathe space into our everyday lives.</h5><br>
                
                You don't have to necessarily lower them but rather make sure they are aligned with reality. What is realistic in this situation? Identify the 
                bare-minimum. Start from there.

                <br><img src="./images/disappointment.jpeg" class="blogimg" alt="Expectations Photo">

                Give yourself the chance to feel like you can succeed. Don't set the bar too high, give space for growth. 
                By lowering one's expectations we are allowing ourselves to attain that nirvana state. Total Zen. 
                These days I'm always impressed. Why? Because I expect nothing. Okay that's only half true.
                <br><br>
                You expect your coworker to pick up the slack and get their half of the job done. Instead they don't do a damn 
                thing and you are left holding the bag. Had you expected them to do absolutely nothing you would have 
                been pleasantly surprised to know they did a fraction of a fraction of the work they were assigned. Also half kidding.
                <br><br>

                <h5 style="background-color: rgb(240, 240, 240); padding: 10px; font-family: Archivo Black;">It's the forever dilemna. Do you set them unreasonably high? Invoke some 
                  type of inferiority complex? Or bottom of the barrell low? Bottom of the barrell low and you may 
                  find yourself never being disappointed.</h5><br>

                <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

                <ul>
                  <li><b>-</b> Be mindful of your expectations</li>
                  <li><b>-</b> Lower your expecations and you will be disappointed less</li>
                  <li><b>-</b> Communicate with others to know what to expect</li>
                  <li><b>-</b> A growth mindset will allow freedom to stay creative and continue trying new things</li>
                  <li><b>-</b> Noone can read your mind, you need to tell others how you feel and what you want</li>
                </ul><br>

                We can avoid frustration, disappointment, and resentment by managing our expectations. This ultimately will increase our chances
                at finding happiness. The world we live in has set our expectations for us a lot of times with television and movies. Be sure to 
                stay realistic and keep them in check, and you will find your nirvana. <br><br><br>

              
                <div style="padding: 20px; background-color: rgb(240, 240, 240);">It's completely normal to hit roadblocks in your relationship. In fact if you didn't have any major roadblocks it
                  would be a concern. Navigating these challenges though is not always as simple as it seems. It helps to talk things out. Therapy can be a great 
                  investment in yourself, your relationship and your future. Happy to share we partnered with
