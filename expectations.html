            <p>You have to keep them low. It's not as easy as it sounds. But the second you start letting them creep up it's game-over.
                It's like letting disappointment marry your best friend. All of the sudden they're around all the time.<br><br>
                Expectations often times lack empathy. They can be toxic to our mental health. We feel let down and sad because
                they weren't met. <br>
              </p>
              <img src="./images/expectations.png" style="display: flex; width: 30%; height: auto; float: right; padding: 20px;">
              <p>
                According to Merriam-Webster "expect" by definition is "to consider probable or certain". In relationships whether it's coworkers or friends or even family members, we set our expectations according to the love and attention
                we give. Maybe you are more thoughtful and expect that same thoughtfulness to be reciprocated. Maybe by default you over-achieve at your job,
                and then expect everyone else to perform in the same fashion. Maybe you bought your sister an amazing birthday present and when the time
                came for her to get you one she forgot. How you managed your expecations through all of these scenarios will define how you feel at the end. 
                If not properly managed, then all of these situations will end with feelings of despondency.  <br> <br>

                Things rarely just go our way. We should expect problems. Expect failures. Expect expectations. Manage Them.
                How can we put the proper practices into place? Communication is the answer. Most times when expectations aren't met it's because they were 
                not properly communicated prior. Our understanding of what will actually happen and what "should" happen in our head are not aligned. 
                <br><br>
                Constantly I'm reminded by my wife that she can't read my mind. She doesn't know what I'm thinking every waking minute of the day. I need to <i>tell</i> her 
                how I am feeling. I need to tell her what I'm expecting. This is allowing us now to manage those expecations and not allow dissappointment.

                <!-- It's the forever dilemna. Do you set them unreasonably high? Invoke some 
                 type of inferiority complex? Or bottom of the barrell low? Bottom of the barrell low and you may 
                 find yourself never being disappointed. <br>
                -->
                Low expectations will breathe space into our everyday lives. <br><br>
                You don't have to necessarily lower them but rather make sure they are aligned with reality. What is realistic in this situation? Identify the 
                bare-minimum. Start from there.
                
                Give yourself the chance to feel like you can succeed. Don't set the bar too high, give space for growth. <br>
                By lowering one's expectations we are allowing ourselves to attain that nirvana state. Total Zen. <br>
                These days I'm always impressed. Why? Because I expect nothing. Okay that's only half true.
                <br><br>
                You expect your coworker to pick up the slack and get their half of the job done. Instead they don't do a damn 
                thing and you are left holding the bag. Had you expected them to do absolutely nothing you would have 
                been pleasantly surprised to know they did a fraction of a fraction of the work they were assigned. Also half kidding.
                <br><br>
                Often times things start to feel unfair and this leads to resentment. Which can trickle down further into passive aggressiveness.
                Nobody needs this. 

                As a husband, a teacher, an office-goer, a band member, and a student now I can relate to all sides. Everything takes time to transpire. The world we live
                in is constantly changing. I expect a website to load in under 1.5 seconds maximum.
