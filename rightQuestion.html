                    If your not asking the right questions, you’re definitely getting the wrong answers. Questions are a massive component of our everyday lives.
                    Both interal and external are equally important. They act as a bridge to getting to know ourselves, others, and the world around us.
                    They allow us to source the solutions to our problems. <br><br>
                    
                    But it's not just about asking the questions themselves, it's about how we phrase them too. 
                    This is especially important in today's digital age where we heavily rely on search engines to get us through our day. If we don't know how to
                    formulate the questions properly, chances are we probably won't find the answers we are looking for. <br><br>

                    Without thinking, we hit <a class='links' href="https://google.com">Google</a> fifty times a day. I needed to replace the alternator on my Nissan Sentra: Google. I
                     wanted to figure out how to have my text be two different colors over an image: Google. I started with “how to have two different 
                    font colors over an image border”. What came up was “How to Create Split Color Text” and of course I’m thinking duh, 
                    Split color, like It’s split in two. I had a few attempts prior to this that lead me to dead ends. If we can't formulate the question proper,
                    how the hell are we going to find the answer? Whether it's music production, signal chain, coding out a new idea, or simply finding a recipe; The 
                    right question will lead you to the right answer.

                <h4>We Learn Through Asking Questions</h4><br>

                    Seems like a no-brainer but it’s true. The only way we can pull new information from the world is by proposing questions and then sourcing 
                    answers. Questions stimulate discussions and force us to think critically. They encourage deeper learning. They help us to 
                    revisit our own thoughts and opinions on a matter, which can then strengthen those thoughts and opinions further. They 
                    expand our knowledge-base, and aid us in our learning journey. <br><br>
                
                <h4>In Our Relationships They Help Establish Trust</h4><br>    
                
                The foundation of any meaningful relationship is trust. And the best way to establish trust in any relationship is through communication. 
                Nobody can just tap into your brain and know exactly 
                what you're thinking at all times. We learn about what our partner is thinking by asking questions and listening. We make friends and surround ourselves
                with like-minded people by learning more about them. Questions again? Without proper communication, 
                trust cannot be established, and trust is literally 99% of any relationship. If I can’t trust you how can we live happily side by side? There 
                will always be doubts and anxiety. Fears will fill the space between us. It’s hard to ask certain questions, ones that make us feel vulnerable. 
                But by doing so and showing our vulnerable side, we are establishing trust and showing that we too are human, we don't know everything. And let's be 
                real, nobody likes a know-it-all. It's annoying how annoying they are. <br><br><br>

                <li id="rainerQuote">What or who has influenced your life decisions the most?</li>
                <li id="rainerQuote">What did you dream about being when you grew up?</li>

                <h4>They Help Get Rid Of Confusion and Misunderstanding</h4><br>
            
                Again not to be repetitive but we have no way of reading each other’s minds. We may have thought we were on the same page because no-one ever 
                stopped to ask the question “Are we on the same page here?”. Questions help ensure that we are aligned with our thought processes which in turn 
                will aid us in our efficiency and productivity. In the workplace, it's important to understand where your coworkers are at in their thoughts 
                to make sure goals, priorities, and deadlines are met. We may even discover new problems along the way because certain questions were proposed. <br><br>

                <h4>Questions Show Vulnerability and Emotional Intelligence</h4><br>

                Being able to show that you don't know everything and that you have a willingness to learn is important. It takes a certain amount of bravery 
                to ask questions because it's basically stating "I don't know, tell me more". They increase your self-awareness and naturally help cultivate
                a growth mindset. They help us point out our mistakes and identify where we can implement a change. <br>
                <img class="blogimg" src="./images/calvin.jpeg" alt="">

                <h4>Conclusion: Questions Help Cultivate A Growth Mindset</h4><br>
                
                I came across a book about five years back that had a profound impact on my life. It's called 
                <a class="links" href="https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Carol-S-Dweck/dp/0345472322">"Mindset: The New Psychology of Success"</a> by Carol Dweck. 
                In short, the book explains the importance of having a growth mindset rather than a fixed one. It shows how changing our beliefs about our abilities 
                can lead to greater success in all areas of life. These said changes stem directly from asking the right questions. We are all ultimately striving to
                be our best while making life a little more manageable. We can achieve this through asking the right questions. We can achieve this by fine-tuning the 
                low-key art of it all.
