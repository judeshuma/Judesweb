            <h2 style="padding: 10px;">How To Solve Problems In Life</h2>
            <p style="text-indent: 0%;">There is an art to solving life's problems. Everyday new challenges pop up
              unexpectedly. Forgetting things, running late, getting sick, technology failing; The list can go on forever. So how do we solve these problems? The answer
              lies in how we react.<br><br>

              
              Since we can’t control problems or when they will appear it's important to focus on what we actual can control. We get to decide how we are going to
              react to the unforeseen situations. Do we get frustrated and blow up? Do we choose to complain and do nothing? Do we pawn them off on someone else? 
              Owning the issue at hand and recognizing that we <a class="newLinks" href="worry.html">cannot change anything</a> immediately is the first step. Take a deep breath, it will be okay. <br><br>
              
              <b><p style="background-color: rgb(240, 240, 240); padding: 10px;">How we react to problems is the key to finding a solution.</p></b>
              <h2>Compartmentalize The Problem</h2>

              Compartmentalize the problem. Break it down into smaller chunks. Problems always have emotional byproducts. Frustration and anxiety start to clutter
              your head. By breaking down the problem we have a better chance at understanding it and solving it. Let's take a list of how we can break them down. <br><br>  
              
              <div style="background-color: rgb(240, 240, 240); padding: 10px;"><br>
                <b>1. Define the Problem:</b> Clearly articulate the problem you're facing. What is the issue or challenge you need to address?<br><br>
                <b>2. Identify the Components:</b> Break down the problem into individual components or elements. What factors contribute to the problem?<br><br>
                <b>3. Prioritize Components:</b> Determine which pieces are most critical to address first. What aspects of the problem are urgent?<br><br>
                <b>4. Organize Components:</b> Arrange the components in a logical and structured manner.<br><br>
                <b>5. Break Components into Subcomponents:</b> Further break down the complex components into smaller subcomponents or tasks. Divide the problem into manageable chunks that can be tackled individually.<br><br>
                <b>6. Develop A Plan Of Action:</b> Determine the steps, resources, and timelines needed to take down the subcomponents.<br><br>
                </div><br>

                <img class="blogimg4" src="./images/overwhelmed.jpeg" alt=""><br>

                This all sounds great on paper, but actually applying it may be a bit confusing at first. Let's take a common
                everyday problem that can apply to almost anyone who has a pulse: <b>Feeling Overwhelmed By a Busy Schedule.</b> <br><br>
                
                <div style="background-color: rgb(240, 240, 240); padding: 10px;"><br>
                  <b>1. Define the Problem:</b> The problem is feeling overwhelmed by a busy schedule.<br><br>
                  <b>2. Identify the Components:</b><br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>-</b> Commitments: Work meetings, appointments, social events, family obligations, etc. <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>-</b> Tasks: Daily chores, work assignments, personal projects, etc. <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>-</b> Responsibilities: Caring for children or elderly relatives, household management, etc. <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>-</b> Time Constraints: Limited time available to complete tasks and fulfill obligations. <br><br>
                  <b>3. Prioritize Components:</b> Determine which pieces are most critical to address first. What aspects of the problem are urgent?<br><br>
                  <b>4. Organize Components:</b> Arrange the components in a logical and structured manner.<br><br>
                  <b>5. Break Components into Subcomponents:</b> Further break down the complex components into smaller subcomponents or tasks. Divide the problem into manageable chunks that can be tackled individually.<br><br>
                  <b>6. Develop A Plan Of Action:</b> Determine the steps, resources, and timelines needed to take down the subcomponents.<br><br>
                  </div><br>
              
                <h2>All The Small Things Add Up</h2>  

                There was a book I stumbled across years back called <a class="newLinks" href="https://amzn.to/3yowptO">“Atomic Habits”</a> by James Clear, that focuses on the idea of small incremental 
                changes in ones behavior, and how together those tiny microscopic changes can help you achieve big things. Little successes adding up. Instead of
                trying to change your entire life all at once, or solve a problem all in one foul swoop, try breaking things down first. <br><br> 
                
                <h2 id="dunning">The Problem of Wanting To Make A Change</h2>   

                Your problem also might run deeper than the everyday one. Maybe you want to make a change to better yourself and you are frustrated 
                that you can't find the motivation. Maybe you want to be a better musician. You picked up an instrument recently but can't seem to 
                find the will power to actually practice. Normally you stowe
                your instrument away under your bed after playing it. Well what if you instead leave it out of the case, and at the end of the couch. Everytime you sit on the couch
                you have already increased your chances of picking it up and practicing. Say it's only five minutes a day. Well over time, those fives minutes will add up and
                by the end of the year you will be a much better player than you were at the start. <br><br>

                <h2 id="dunning">You Can't Do It All At Once</h2>   

                The same can be said for wanting to read more. Maybe you set a new years resolution that you were going to read ten books this year. Maybe it was only 
                one book and it's <a class="newLinks" href="https://amzn.to/4dw7GnJ">Infinite Jest</a>. And it's May
                and you haven't picked up a book yet. We've all been there. Try putting the book on your pillow so you have a better chance at actually picking it up. Try 
                to read five pages a day. You don't have to read the whole thing at once. Get into a flow state. We as humans are creatures of habits, and there 
                can be a lot of upside to that if used properly. Little bits slowly add up.  <br><br>

                <img class="blogimg4" src="images/Overwhelmed-todays-to-do-list.jpeg" alt=""><br>

                You can't control what happens to you or what situations will arise. Living in today's world can be extremely stressful. Between cell phones, social media, and emails 
                it feels like a never-ending stream of "I need to do this, I need to do that". You add in everyday problems and yeah, at times life can feel impossible. But it is 
                possible. And by subdividing your problems into smaller ones, implimenting minor changes, or taking smaller steps towards goals you want to accomplish you can 
                propel yourself forward. <br><br>

                Remember the one thing we do have control over when it comes to problems is our reactions. There is a lot of solace to be found in that. <br><br>  
        
                <div style="padding: 20px; background-color: rgb(240, 240, 240);">It's completely normal to hit roadblocks in life. In fact if you didn't have any major roadblocks it
                  would be a concern. Navigating these challenges though is not always as simple as it seems. It helps to talk things out. Therapy can be a great 
                  investment in yourself and your future. Happy to share we partnered with

  Step two: Compartmentalize the problem. Break it down into smaller chunks. <br>
                <br><img src="./images/breakingdown.jpeg" class="blogimg" alt="Breakdown Chart"><br>
                <b>Break.</b><br><br>
                <b>It.</b><br><br>
                <b>Down.</b><br>
                <br> There was a book I stumbled across years back called <a href="https://a.co/d/71g3hRM">“Atomic Habits”</a> by James Clear that focuses on the idea of small incremental 
                changes in ones behavior, and how together those tiny microscopic changes can help you achieve big things. Little successes add up. Instead of
                trying to change your entire life all at once, try making small adjustments first.  For instance, you want to be a better musician. Normally you stowe
                your instrument away under your bed. Well what if you instead leave it out of the case, and at the end of the couch. Everytime you sit on the couch
                you have already increased your chances of picking it up and practicing. Say it's only five minutes a day. Well over time those fives minutes will add up and
                by the end of the year you will be a much better player than you were at the start. <br><br>
                Now let’s apply a similar logic to problem solving. What if instead of attacking the whole problem all at once, we instead subdivide it into smaller baby problems. If the 
                subproblem is still to difficult then subdivide the subproblem into a smaller subproblem. Keep breaking it down until you hit the point where it feels achievable. <br> <br>
                <img src="./images/math.jpeg" style="display: flex; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 50px;" alt="Math on chalkboard">
                I wanted to build a web app. Great. Where do I even start? Well I needed to choose the language to write it in. Okay python3 great. Now what? I want to have two inputs and 
                be able to click a button and display my desired output. Well before I can do any of that I need to figure out how can I display the app. I need to find a way to render it 
                on the screen for the user. Great <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html">Tkinter</a>. Break down Tkinter now. How do I form a box for the app to sit in. 
                How can I create input boxes and the basic layout. Before I even get to having my app run a more complex python code I’ll break it down again. Can I get my app to run a 
                basic math problem? Two input variables that when I click the button, will come together into a single output? Great I got that, now substitute the integers will my desired 
                variables. I broke down every single facet the whole way through. <br> <br>
                You want to write a song. Great. How many parts will the song have? Forget that, let’s start with a verse. Let’s find a basic chord progression to work with. Great. Now 
                how about an outline of a melody. Now let’s start on the chorus. Melody next. Now we can focus on instrumentation. What instruments do we like? What about the drum beat? Is 
                there a drum beat? By breaking things down we can achieve little bits of success at a time, which in turn give us confidence to keep moving forward, and slowly we accomplish 
                what we set out to in the first place. Nothing comes easy, that’s a fact. But by attacking the macro problem at hand by subdividing we can rise to great heights.  -->
