          <b><p>“It's not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters.” <br>
            ― Epictetus
            </p></b>
            <p>It happens to everyone. As we navigate through our days, life is constantly throwing problems at us. It’s inevitable. Inescapable. Without a solution to these 
              problems nothing will change. And change is for the better right?<br><br> 
              Problems propose frustration, anxiety, fear, shame, and disappointment; The list goes on. It’s not you it’s me I swear. Well actually it’s the windstorm that took out the Silver Maple tree in my front yard, thats now 
              collapsed and resting on the leather sofa in my living room, allowing the rain to come in. <br>  
              Yeah that sucks. We can’t control the problems, we can’t even say when the next one will appear. What we can control though, is how we react to them.
              Do we get frustrated and blow up? Do we choose to complain and do nothing? Do we try to pawn the problem off on someone else? Owning the issue at hand is the first major step.
                Step two: Compartmentalize the problem. Break it down into smaller chunks. <br>
                <br><img src="./images/breakingdown.jpeg" class="blogimg" alt="Breakdown Chart"><br>
                <b>Break.</b><br><br>
                <b>It.</b><br><br>
                <b>Down.</b><br>
                <br> There was a book I stumbled across years back called <a href="https://a.co/d/71g3hRM">“Atomic Habits”</a> by James Clear that focuses on the idea of small incremental 
                changes in ones behavior, and how together those tiny microscopic changes can help you achieve big things. Little successes add up. Instead of
                trying to change your entire life all at once, try making small adjustments first.  For instance, you want to be a better musician. Normally you stowe
                your instrument away under your bed. Well what if you instead leave it out of the case, and at the end of the couch. Everytime you sit on the couch
                you have already increased your chances of picking it up and practicing. Say it's only five minutes a day. Well over time those fives minutes will add up and
                by the end of the year you will be a much better player than you were at the start. <br><br>
                Now let’s apply a similar logic to problem solving. What if instead of attacking the whole problem all at once, we instead subdivide it into smaller baby problems. If the 
                subproblem is still to difficult then subdivide the subproblem into a smaller subproblem. Keep breaking it down until you hit the point where it feels achievable. <br> <br>

                I wanted to build a web app. Great. Where do I even start? Well I needed to choose the language to write it in. Okay python3 great. Now what? I want to have two inputs and 
                be able to click a button and display my desired output. Well before I can do any of that I need to figure out how can I display the app. I need to find a way to render it 
                on the screen for the user. Great <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html">Tkinter</a>. Break down Tkinter now. How do I form a box for the app to sit in. 
                How can I create input boxes and the basic layout. Before I even get to having my app run a more complex python code I’ll break it down again. Can I get my app to run a 
                basic math problem? Two input variables that when I click the button, will come together into a single output? Great I got that, now substitute the integers will my desired 
                variables. I broke down every single facet the whole way through. <br> <br>
                You want to write a song. Great. How many parts will the song have? Forget that, let’s start with a verse. Let’s find a basic chord progression to work with. Great. Now 
                how about an outline of a melody. Now let’s start on the chorus. Melody next. Now we can focus on instrumentation. What instruments do we like? What about the drum beat? Is 
                there a drum beat? By breaking things down we can achieve little bits of success at a time, which in turn give us confidence to keep moving forward, and slowly we accomplish 
                what we set out to in the first place. Nothing comes easy, that’s a fact. But by attacking the macro problem at hand by subdividing we can rise to great heights.
