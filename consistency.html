              <h2 id="dunning">Building Trust Through Consistency</h2>

                We build trust through being consistent. Whether it’s fulfilling promises in 
                a relationship over and over, or dictating a color scheme or font type for a brand, by being consistent we are showing we are trustworthy.
                 When something or someone is consistent, people get a better 
                sense of what to expect, leading to feelings of comfort and dependability. The more comfortable we feel, the more likely we are to open up. And 
                when we open ourselves up, this makes way for a deeper connection. That connection proves more trust. See the cycle? <br><br>
                
                <h2 id="dunning">Branding As An Example</h2>  
                
                By staying unchanged in your brand and design, 
                consumers are much more likely to trust that you will come through on your promise 
                and deliver on it. They feel like they know you. This can apply to a small indie artist all the way to a major Fortune 500 company. 
                It helps establish your brand, formulate recognition, and let people know who you are.<br><br>
                
                Imagine a world where Starbucks flipped from their iconic green to an ocean blue. And then Target abandoned their classic red and 
                decided on a flat grey instead. A world where Mcdonald's "Golden" Arches are no longer golden. How would it make you feel if they changed their colors monthly? It’s 
                like I don’t even know you anymore right? These are tools for recognition.
                Companies need to make decisions when establishing themselves to allow people to recognize them and build a meaningful relationship. Choose 
                a font type and voice for your marketing materials and stick with it. Be persistent with it and over time you will win them over.<br><br>         
                
                <h2>Actions Speak Louder Than Words</h2>
                
                If you say you are going to do something and you follow through on it, it shows you care, which in turn develops trust. That trust then 
                transpires into loyalty. When we 
                enter a new relationship we don’t know what to expect, we are willing to take a risk. If I promise you I will be there this 
                Tuesday at 8PM and I don’t show up, will you trust me the next time I say it? If the newly elected president promises to ratify a treaty, but 
                rather extends the war instead, are they likely to be reelected? This is why it's important to stay unwavered. So if you 
                are going to be inconsistent, then be consistently inconsistent...right?<br><br>

                <h2>We Rely On Trust</h2> 
                
                Trust lies at the heart of all social relationships. Everything starts with it. One could argue it’s the most important aspect of any meaningful relationship.
                 We use it as a tool to 
                help us navigate through life. Whether it’s traveling abroad in a new culture, finding love, or purchasing something new for the 
                first time, it is our means of making educated decisions. From a young age we are taught to not engage with strangers. 
                Why? Because they can’t be trusted. The concept of building trust over time is literally baked into society. It takes times
                and repetition for a sense of trust to be established. We learn to grow our trust in people who are there for us consistently 
                through the good times and bad.  <br><br>

                <b><p style="background-color: rgb(240, 240, 240); padding: 10px;">Everything starts with trust. It lies at the heart of all successful relationships.</p></b><br>

                Trust builds feelings of comfort and safety, dissembles stress and anxiety, and helps people work towards their goals. It’s an 
                important factor in any business, whether you are in a band, a software startup, or working in a factory. Teamwork is the foundation 
                for success. The ability to rely on one another allows businesses, 
                relationships, and organizations to flourish and grow. We build trust in the workplace setting to help us come together to 
                achieve collective goals. <br><br>
                
                <h2>Innocent Until Proven Guilty</h2>
                
                Trust is typically earned. And unless told otherwise, we have no reason to trust something or someone for the first time. It's 
                going out on a limb and putting yourself at risk. Will you get stood up? Will you get ripped off? It's only when actions meet 
                words that we can start to formulate a significant relationship. <br><br>

                
                
                When entering into a new relationship, whether it's with a new coffee brand or your first tinder date, it’s important to deliver on your promises. 
                When starting a business it’s important to choose aesthetics that will stay with you the entire way. Trust is built through
                continuously staying true over time. <br><br> Trust = Consistency | Consistency = Trust <br><br>
