          <b><p style="text-align: left;">“I can't go on. I'll go on” ― Samuel Beckett</p></b>
            
            <p>I've been letting go as of late. Let's call it Sunny Nihilism. By definition, nihilism is the viewpoint that life is meaningless.
            Existence is futile. There is no real point to anything or anyone. We live...and die...and then...nothing. Sounds tragic right? 
            
            <br><br>The term is often 
            associated with extreme pessimism and radical skepticism. Without an idea of purpose everything starts to feel hopeless. But what if it doesn't have to be so bad? What if 
            instead, the meaninglessness empowers us. It allows us to let go of the everyday stress and focus more on being conscious in the moment? You can 
            stop leaning in on the flaws and minor stains. If there's no intended purpose for us being here, then we get to choose our own purpose.

            <h4>Nothing Really Matters: So You Get To Decide What Does</h4>

            If all of it amounts to nothing, then you get to decide what really matters in your life. Is it the relationships you keep? Is it skydiving in Nebraska? It doesn't matter 
            because nothing really matters. There's no point in not living your life the 
            way you want if that's the case. If rock climbing and self development means something to you, go for it. If photography of flat faced cats means the world 
            to you, find the time, and go for it. You might as well right? <br><br>
            
            You get to decide what holds meaning because 
            it's your life, because that's all there is. Outside of that there's nothing. In ten thousand years Bob Dylan, Oprah Winfrey, and Drake will be 
            a sentence in a textbook. In a million years the earth may not even exist. So why not try to live more in the moment. Why not look around 
            and appreciate whatever it is that makes you happy? Let go of the everyday bullshit that's cluttering your head. <br><br>

           <h4>It’s all a part of the human condition and the human construct: The inherent need for a greater meaning to it all.</h4><br>

            There was a famous play written in the 1950s by a man named Samuel Beckett called "Waiting For Godot". The book had a profound impact on my life (hopefully yours too). 
            It's a single-sitting type read so I highly encourage you to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Waiting-Godot-Tragicomedy-Two-Acts/dp/080214442X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1CY364F5S94DM&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.EBV63iv1RMPhPhJ6Kvt16nZmI8bEBJGnVfWRQa4ZLuAV9bBlI2iPDBEdlDv6BZN5CNf7HCX8574uwtvE6DreCEWq2YjpxW1CqgjM_aaNsKJkdmGdVz3MrFv2utWbNq0HOvzFdEx62L4Y1wIjkqTod3LNlod-gHdo_2eN1MKNdWjgXozFkOkh5eJRRu5SebZMqSoOFhywdsQ9RtPYhbCrg-gqVMGlfcyaYuB9ykpfb58.I6Fbl3saoW818W7M86B9sHw1XAmF52bRbBleNe4zvH0&dib_tag=se&keywords=waiting+for+godot&qid=1712686184&sprefix=waiting+for+godot%2Caps%2C154&sr=8-1">check it out</a>
             if you haven't. It revolves around two main characters in the thick of an existential crisis; Waiting for something they don't fully
            understand. Their struggle to find some type of meaning in a world without answers is endless. They have their free will to do what they wish but yet here they 
            are still waiting. Is it giving purpose? Is it giving meaning? Is it filling up time and space? It's Beckett's way of finding humor in the absurd nature of existence. <br><br>        

            <p id="rainerquote"><b>“We wait. We are bored. No, don’t protest, we are bored to death, there’s no denying it. Good. A diversion comes along 
                and what do we do? We let it go to waste....In an instant, all will vanish and we’ll be alone once more, in the midst of 
                nothingness.”</b> -Vladamir <i>Waiting For Godot</i></p> 

            Beckett has a way of bringing humor to the nothingness. Isn't it better to laugh? We as humans are thrown into the darkness upon birth, we arrive 
            with nothing but questions. What if you are capable of freeing ourselves from this battle? It'll take some time and practice, but it's possible. Catching ourselves 
            in the moment is the <a href="worry.html">first step.</a> <br><br>

            <img class="blogimg2" src="./images/beckett.jpeg" alt=""> <br>

            We live in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age">Information Age</a>, life is complicated and non-stop. Cell phones have become an extension of 
            one's being. Never before have we had so many answers and questions at the same time. So set out to make the most of it all. Accomplishing anything is always easier said than done. But hey
            everything is meaningless, including your life and mine, so there's really no need to stress. Get out there and live your best life. Push on and find your path to happiness.<br><br>
