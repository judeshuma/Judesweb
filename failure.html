                It happens. And we all can agree that it generally sucks. Failure is just as much a part of life as breathing. How do we fail though? 
                How do we cope with it? How we perceive those inevitable moments of setback will directly impact our success and our future. <br>

                <h4>Growth Mindset vs Fixed</h4>
                <p>Do you view failure as permanent? Do you generally choose tasks that are easier with a higher success rate? Carol Dweck wrote a 
                    book called <a href="https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B000FCKPHG&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_AH1CAF6ZJPPRSYC13AHH">The Growth Mindset</a> that confronts the idea of 
                    failing and how we perceive it. Seeing it as an opportunity to do 
                    better, figure it out, and grow from it rather than let it discourage us from moving forward.</p> <br>

                <h4>Failure Is Only Temporary</h4>
                <p>When I think of failing, I think of a staircase. Each step is a smaller failure, ultimately building the staircase to the top.  
                    Failure isn’t permanent, it’s a necessary step (pun intended) to getting to where you want to be. It’s also not the same as 
                    defeat. Defeat is a choice when confronted with the idea of failure. Accept it and move on. Take it as a challenge to try and do better.</p> <br>

                <h4>Don’t Be So Hard On Yourself, Stay With It</h4>
                <p>No infant comes out of the womb walking. You have to crawl before you can walk and walk before you can run. It takes time 
                    and a lot of failing. Stay with it. Personally I’ve failed at music, failed at programming, failed at love, failed in every 
                    single aspect of my life at some point. But I didn’t give up. Those terrible songs got better and I got my first song-license on 
                    <a href="https://www.hbo.com/ballers/season-1/8-gaslighting">HBO's Ballers</a>, after breaking my web app <a href="https://chordo.app">Chordo</a> fifty times it finally got deployed. The girl of my dreams, who once had me in the 
                    friend-zone, accepted my proposal to be married. None of this would have happened had I just said screw it I’m done.</p> <br>
  
                <p>As a teacher I’ve witnessed a multitude of personalities. So many students who give up way before they even come close to hitting 
                    their stride. It’s all persistence. Those who achieve success stick with it despite their failures. They view them as a learning experience. Taking on
                    an instrument and starting from zero takes a lot of time, practice, and patience. I have to remind my students our hands weren't necessarily 
                    designed to stretch across the neck of a guitar. You need to stick with it to develop that muscle memory.</p>  <br>

                <h4>Finding Ways To Stay Motivated Amidst Setbacks</h4>
                <p>Where does motivation come from? Does it stem from “wanting more”? It’s oftentimes hard to stay motivated when confronting multiple 
                    failures. You need a support system. Either friends, family, or colleagues you can relate to.  Sometimes I find myself trying to trick my mind by 
                    saying I can have “a reward” if I complete the task at hand. Motivation is very personal, it all falls on a single person at the end of the day: You. 
                    Finding ways to stay motivated is half the battle. </p> <br>

                <h4>Surround yourself with like-minded people</h4>
                <p>One way to help stay motivated is surrounding yourself with like-minded people. We feed off of one another’s energy. If you are surrounded 
                    by people who are lethargic and unmotivated, chances are you will feel no different. If your friends have zero ambitions and a fixed mindset, 
                    you will be no different. I figured this out a little while back and I wound up letting go of a bunch of friendships. Haven't looked back since. </p> <br>

                <img class="blogimg2" src="./images/failure.jpeg" alt="">

                <h4>Track Your Progress</h4>
                <p> I often times set up my studio to record a new student because I know it’s hard to recognize your own growth. You don’t see your nephew 
                    for 5 months and wow how you’ve grown, but if you see them everyday it’s much harder to identify it. By creating timestamps it allows us to look
                    back and see that we have in fact made steps forward. If you are working out maybe that’s a photo once a week. Find ways to showcase where you are at 
                    so when you are feeling despondent you will have some inspiration to go off of.</p> 
                
                <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>    
                <p>Confronting Failure Doesn’t Have To Suck. We all have to deal with it so it shouldn’t be too hard to find others to lean on. Don’t be 
                    afraid to put yourself out there. We all are human. Accepting that failure is just another part of existence. Learning to finesse that
                    failure is just the first step to getting yourself to where you want to be.</p>
